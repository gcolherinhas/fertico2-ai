# FertiCO₂-AI

FertiCO₂-AI is an open, modular and fully reproducible computational framework
designed to classify and predict CO₂ absorption potential in amino acid ionic
liquids (AAILs) using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning.

This repository contains:
- Molecular dynamics simulation pipelines (GROMACS)
- Descriptor extraction workflows
- Machine learning models for ordinal CO₂ absorption classification
- Full reproducibility scripts and documentation
